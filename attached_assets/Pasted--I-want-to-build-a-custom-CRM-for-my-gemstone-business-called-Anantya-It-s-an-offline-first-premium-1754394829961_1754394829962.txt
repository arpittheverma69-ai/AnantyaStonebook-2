"I want to build a custom CRM for my gemstone business called Anantya. It's an offline-first premium gemstone trading firm. The CRM must include modules for managing:

Suppliers (domestic + international)

Product Inventory (with certification status, weight, type, origin)

Client Database (jewelers, astrologers, temples)

Sales Transactions (per client, per stone)

Certification Tracking (IGI, GJEPC, etc.)

Packaging & Delivery Tracking

Consultation Logs (offline in-person meetings)

Finance – Purchase, Sale, Margin, Profit tracking

Tasks & Reminders (for follow-ups, certification due, etc.)

It must allow filtering by stone type, carat, price range, supplier, client type (jeweler/astrologer/etc.), and city. Each record should support file uploads (like lab certificate PDFs), custom tags (like ‘high margin’, ‘certified’, etc.), and allow report generation.

The UI should be clean, mobile-friendly, and designed for offline-first field sales. Include dashboard widgets showing:

Monthly sales

Pending certifications

Top-performing clients

Inventory value

Upcoming follow-ups"
